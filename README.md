# HR_Analytics
In this Human Resources analytics project, I harnessed the capabilities of both Tableau and Power BI to delve into employee data, uncover meaningful patterns, and generate actionable insights to aid the HR department's strategies and decision-making. 
The project's core objective was to gain a comprehensive understanding of workforce trends, performance, and engagement. To achieve this I imported the excel data (after cleaning) into Tableau and Power BI where I created fully dynamic dashboards that summarize the conclusions drawn.
